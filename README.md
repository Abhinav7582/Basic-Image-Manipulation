# Basic-Image-Manipulation

Many applications use digital images, and with this, there is usually a need to process the images used. If you are building your application with Python and need to add image processing features to it, there are various libraries you could use. Some popular ones are OpenCV, scikit-image, Python Imaging Library and Pillow.

We won't debate on which library is the best here; they all have their merits. This article will focus on Pillow, a powerful library that provides a wide array of image processing features and is simple to use.

Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL). PIL is a library that offers several standard procedures for manipulating images. It's a powerful library but hasn't been updated since 2009 and doesn't support Python 3. Pillow builds on this, adding more features and support for Python 3. It supports a range of image file formats such as PNG, JPEG, PPM, GIF, TIFF, and BMP. We'll see how to perform various operations on images such as cropping, resizing, adding text to images, rotating, greyscaling, etc., using this library.
